          </h4>
          <p>
            This workshop aims to provide an able forum for an exchange of ideas
            in different aspects of Applicable Mathematics in Science and
            Engineering. It draws particular emphasis to the understanding of
            the modelling aspects to real-world problems. Also this workshop
            provides hands-on sessions using modern software tools like MATLAB,
            MATHEMATICA, R and CFD. The scope of AMSE 2023 covers Bio fluid
            dynamics, Heat and Mass transfer, Mathematical Biology, Statistics
            and Data Science to name a few. This workshop will introduce new
            perspectives to solving potential problems using various software
            and help participants sharpen their skills, refine their ideas and
            update developments in the subject domain.
